					<h3>Objective</h3>
				<p>The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's five oceans, [2] It covers approximately 20% of Earth's surface and about 29% of its water surface area. It is known to separate the "Old World" of Africa, Europe, and Asia from the "New World" of the Americas in the European perception of the World.You may think I'm proposing that we create a corrected, separate list. But no. Actually, the whole notion of listing the drainage basin of oceans by country seems silly. Even for the Mediterranean, it seems silly and pedantic. (And you can see that various editors on that article have been confused by this notion.) Why is this worth recording in the infobox of these large bodies of water? Countries are not meaningful geophysical units, and a list of scores of countries seems pretty much useless. (Should we also include a complete list of the countries in the Eastern Hemisphere?) It looks like the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean articles don't include this field in their infobox -- that seems much more sensible to me.</p>
